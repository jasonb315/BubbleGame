Building the Game

    - [x] The game starts when the page loads.

    - [ ] When the game starts, a new dot should appear on the playing area.

    - [ ] Dots fall smoothly at a constant rate. A player should be able to use a SLIDER to control the speed at which dots fall. 

    - [ ] When the SLIDER is changed, all dots including currently falling dots and newly created dots should change speed.

    - [ ] At the SLIDER's left-most position, dots should fall at a speed of 10px per second, and at the SLIDER's right-most position, should fall at a speed of 100px per second.

    - [ ] New dots appear at a random horizontal position at the top of the box. A dot should not "hang" off the left or right edge of the screen. Dots should vary randomly in size from 10px in diameter to 100px in diameter.

    - [ ] When a player touches or clicks a dot, the dot should disappear from the box and a new dot should appear at the top of the page 1000ms later. The score should be incremented by a value inversely proportional to the size of the dot, with 10px dots worth 10 points, and 100px dots worth 1 point.

    - [ ] A new dot should also appear every 1000ms.
